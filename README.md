# Wedding Invitation App

I built this website for my own wedding 💍💍 — a fully functional RSVP platform with personalized invitations, envelope animations, and guest management tools.

## Features

- **Personalized RSVP Links**  
  Each guest receives a unique link to access their invitation, view a custom envelope-opening animation with their name, and respond directly.

- **Elegant Invite Animation**  
  A wedding-themed animation opens a virtual envelope, revealing the invitation in a smooth and festive way.

- **RSVP & Logistics**  
  Guests can mark whether they’re attending and additional info.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  An admin page (currently restricted to me) provides live stats and a breakdown of guest responses.

- **Multilingual Support**  

- **Wedding Info**  
  The homepage includes all the key details: venue, schedule, and logistics.

*Admin access is currently limited to me, hoping to develop a more generalized platform in the future.*
